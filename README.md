## Syllabus ##

Find a PDF [here](SyllabusAndFirstDay/375Syllabus.pdf) (you may need to click on "View Raw").

## Textbook(s) ##

Main textbook: Schroeder's [Introduction to Thermal Physics][Schroeder].
It comes with some supplemental resources, but Schroeder's [blog](http://dvschroeder.blogspot.com/) is interesting and often relevant.

Required supplemental text: Gould and Tobochnik's [Thermal and Statistical Physics][GandT]. Please note that the book is available for free in PDF form both in the previous link and directly on [comPADRE][GandTComp].

## Resources ##

IPython Notebooks and Excel Files from Chapter 2 may be found in [the IntroProbability section](IntroProbability/)

Monte Carlo introduction and our start at Ising models may be found in the [Chapter 8](Chapter8/) and [Other Monte Carlo](OtherMonteCarlo/) sections.

The first homework for March Madness Monte Carlo may be found [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mglerner/MarchMadnessMonteCarlo/blob/master/Homework/MMMC2015Homework1.ipynb)
