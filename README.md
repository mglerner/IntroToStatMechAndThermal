## Syllabus ##

Find a PDF [here](SyllabusAndFirstDay/375Syllabus.pdf) (you may need to click on "View Raw").

## Textbook(s) ##

Main textbook: Schroeder's [Introduction to Thermal Physics][Schroeder].
It comes with some supplemental resources, but Schroeder's [blog](http://dvschroeder.blogspot.com/) is interesting and often relevant.

Required supplemental text: Gould and Tobochnik's [Thermal and Statistical Physics][GandT]. Please note that the book is available for free in PDF form both in the previous link and directly on [comPADRE][GandTComp].
